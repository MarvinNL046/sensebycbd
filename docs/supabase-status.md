# Supabase Status Report

## Current Status

As of March 1, 2025, the Supabase integration in the SenseBy CBD project is in good condition:

1. **Supabase Packages**: Both the Supabase JavaScript client (`@supabase/supabase-js`) and the Supabase CLI are up to date with the latest versions.

2. **Database Schema**: The database schema has been updated with the latest migration (`20250228_update_orders_table.sql`), which made the following changes to the orders table:
   - Renamed `total` column to `total_amount`
   - Added new columns: `shipping_info` (JSONB), `payment_info` (JSONB), and `loyalty_points_earned` (INTEGER)
   - Removed columns: `shipping_address` and `payment_id`
   - Recreated constraints and indexes

3. **Code Compatibility**: All code in the project has been updated to use the new schema. The following files have been checked and confirmed to be using the updated schema:
   - `lib/db.ts` - Uses `total_amount`, `shipping_info`, `payment_info`, and `loyalty_points_earned`
   - `lib/mockDb.ts` - Uses `total_amount` and `loyalty_points_earned`
   - `pages/account/index.tsx` - Uses `total_amount`, `shipping_info`, `payment_info`, and `loyalty_points_earned`

4. **Migration Tools**: The project has been set up with tools to manage database migrations:
   - A custom migration script (`scripts/create-migration.js`) to create well-structured migration files
   - NPM scripts in package.json for common migration tasks
   - Documentation in `docs/supabase-management.md` explaining how to use these tools

## Recommendations

1. **Local Development Setup**: To improve the local development experience, consider setting up a local Supabase instance using Docker. This would allow you to test database changes locally before applying them to the production database.

2. **Authentication Issues**: There were some issues with authenticating to the Supabase instance using the CLI. This could be due to:
   - Incorrect database password
   - Network restrictions
   - Supabase configuration issues

   To resolve this, you could:
   - Check the database password in the Supabase dashboard
   - Try connecting from a different network
   - Contact Supabase support if the issue persists

3. **Regular Backups**: Ensure that regular backups of the Supabase database are being made, especially before applying migrations.

4. **Testing**: Consider adding tests for database operations to ensure that the code continues to work with the updated schema.

## Future Improvements

1. **Automated Migrations**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automatically apply migrations when changes are pushed to the main branch.

2. **Database Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for the Supabase database to track performance and detect issues.

3. **Schema Documentation**: Create and maintain documentation for the database schema to help new developers understand the data model.

4. **Data Validation**: Add more robust data validation in the application code to ensure that data sent to Supabase is valid.

## Conclusion

The Supabase integration in the SenseBy CBD project is well-maintained and up to date. The recent migration to update the orders table schema has been successfully applied, and all code in the project has been updated to use the new schema. The project has good tools and documentation for managing database migrations, which will help maintain the database schema in the future.
