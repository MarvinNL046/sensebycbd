# Grid Visibility Fix

## Issue
The grids for two sections on the homepage (FeaturedProducts and CategoriesGrid) were not visible.

## Root Causes

1. **Intersection Observer Issue**: Both components were using an Intersection Observer to trigger animations when the section is visible, but this was causing the sections to remain invisible until they were scrolled into view.

2. **Translation Issues**: Some translation keys were missing in the non-English translation files, which could cause issues when viewing the site in other languages.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Intersection Observer Logic

In both the `FeaturedProducts.tsx` and `CategoriesGrid.tsx` components, we modified the Intersection Observer logic to ensure the content is visible by default:

```typescript
// Before
const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false);

// After
const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(true); // Set to true by default
```

We also simplified the useEffect hook to immediately set isVisible to true, ensuring the content is always visible regardless of scroll position:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Set isVisible to true immediately to ensure content is visible
  setIsVisible(true);
  
  // Original Intersection Observer code commented out
}, []);
```

### 2. Completed Translation Files

We updated all non-English translation files (Dutch, German, and French) to include all the necessary keys that were present in the English translation file. This ensures that the site works correctly in all supported languages.

## Results

After implementing these changes, both the FeaturedProducts and CategoriesGrid sections are now visible on the homepage without requiring the user to scroll. The sections appear immediately when the page loads, providing a better user experience.

## Additional Notes

There are still some warnings in the console related to images with "fill" property not having a height value. These warnings don't affect the visibility of the sections but could be addressed in a future update to improve the site's performance and appearance.

```
Image with src "/images/products/product-oil-1.jpg" has "fill" and a height value of 0. This is likely because the parent element of the image has not been styled to have a set height.
```

This could be fixed by ensuring that all parent elements of images with the "fill" property have a defined height.
