# Product System Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the product system for the SenseBy CBD webshop, including product detail pages, Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), and product filtering functionality.

## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive product system with the following features:

1. **Product Detail Pages**: Fully functional product detail pages with all necessary blocks
2. **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Implemented for product pages to ensure fresh content
3. **Dynamic Routes**: Created `generateStaticParams` for all dynamic routes
4. **Product Filtering**: Implemented filtering and search functionality
5. **Translated URL Slugs**: Implemented for multilingual support

## Implementation Details

### 1. Product Detail Pages

The product detail page (`pages/products/[slug].tsx`) includes the following components:

- **ProductGallery**: Displays the main product image and additional images with a thumbnail gallery
- **ProductInfo**: Shows product details, pricing, and add to cart functionality
- **ProductSpecifications**: Displays product specifications in a tabbed interface
- **RelatedProducts**: Shows related products from the same category

### 2. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

ISR has been implemented for all product-related pages:

- **Product Detail Pages**: Revalidate every 10 minutes (600 seconds)
- **Category Pages**: Revalidate every 30 minutes (1800 seconds)
- **Products Index Page**: Revalidate every 15 minutes (900 seconds)

This ensures that product data stays fresh while maintaining the performance benefits of static generation.

### 3. Dynamic Routes with `generateStaticParams`

We've implemented `generateStaticParams` for all dynamic routes to support Next.js 13+ App Router compatibility:

- **Product Pages**: Generates parameters for all products in all supported languages
- **Category Pages**: Generates parameters for all categories in all supported languages

This ensures that our site will be ready for migration to the App Router in the future.

### 4. Product Filtering and Search

The products index page (`pages/products/index.tsx`) includes comprehensive filtering options:

- **Category Filtering**: Filter products by category
- **Price Range Filtering**: Filter products by minimum and maximum price
- **CBD Percentage Filtering**: Filter products by CBD percentage
- **Search Functionality**: Search products by name or description
- **Sorting Options**: Sort products by newest, price (low to high), or price (high to low)

### 5. Translated URL Slugs

We've implemented translated URL slugs for multilingual support:

- **Product Slugs**: Translated for all supported languages (EN, NL, DE, FR)
- **Category Slugs**: Translated for all supported languages (EN, NL, DE, FR)

This improves SEO for international markets and provides a better user experience for non-English speakers.

## Mock Data Implementation

For development and testing purposes, we've implemented a mock data system:

- **mockData.ts**: Contains mock product and category data
- **mockDb.ts**: Provides database-like functions that use the mock data

This allows us to develop and test the product system without relying on the actual database.

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements to the product system include:

1. **Product Reviews**: Add user reviews and ratings
2. **Product Variants**: Support for product variants (e.g., different strengths, flavors)
3. **Product Bundles**: Create product bundles and special offers
4. **Enhanced Filtering**: Add more filtering options (e.g., product tags, benefits)
5. **Product Comparison**: Allow users to compare multiple products

## Conclusion

The implemented product system provides a solid foundation for the SenseBy CBD webshop. It includes all the necessary features for a modern e-commerce site, with a focus on performance, SEO, and user experience.
